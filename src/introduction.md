# introduction

## welcome to tripleSinfobot!
with the rise of misinformation regarding tripleS, i find it extremely important that tripleS fans (swisse) continue to combat and prevent this misinformation from spreading. 

the bot makes this easier, allowing users to simply tag the bot and use a command in a tweet. the bot will then reply with a thread containing the relevant information, correctly informing whoever reads the thread and preventing tripleS from gaining a bad name over misinformation.

## how to use the bot
simply send a tweet with `@tripleSinfobot !<command>` and the bot will reply! 

for example, `@tripleSinfobot !guide` will trigger the relevant thread.
